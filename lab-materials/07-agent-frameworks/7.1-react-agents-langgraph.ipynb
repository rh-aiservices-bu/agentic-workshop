    "\n",
    "In this section, we will build a ReAct agent that autonomously reasons through tasks and selects the appropriate tools to solve problems. The agent will follow a structured process to deliver actionable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 Architecture Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Components**:\n",
    "  - **Memory**: The agent's memory module stores past interactions and relevant data to inform future decisions.\n",
    "  - **Planning**: This module breaks down complex tasks into manageable steps, helping the agent decide the sequence of actions.\n",
    "  - **Tools**: The tools module enables the agent to interact with external systems, such as performing calculations, retrieving data, or running APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Prompt & User Prompt**: \n",
    "  - The **System Prompt** provides context and instructions for how the agent should operate within its environment, including the tools available.\n",
    "  - The **User Prompt** is the input provided by the user, specifying the task or query the agent needs to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Interaction**: \n",
    "  - The Large Language Model (LLM) is at the core of the agent’s decision-making. It processes both the system and user prompts, and its outputs guide the agent’s actions. The LLM can reason about tasks, plan, and adapt based on external tool outputs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **External Environments**:\n",
    "  - The **Local Environment** consists of tools and systems the agent interacts with locally on its workstation.\n",
    "  - The **External Environment** is any external system or API that the agent can call for additional information or actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture allows the ReAct agent to efficiently break down complex tasks, take action, and observe the results in a structured, repeatable process.\n",

    "### 7. Using React Agents with Complex Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will execute the `ReActAgent` to demonstrate how it processes user input, interacts with tools, and follows the **Thought → Action → Observation** loop to produce a final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Run the Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Agent**: \n",
    "   - We start by setting up the initial state, defining the agent's role, specifying the available tools, and connecting the agent to a language model service.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **User Request**: \n",
    "   - A user query is provided as input, such as \"What is the sum of 15 and 27?\" The agent receives this request and starts reasoning through it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Processing the Request**:\n",
    "   - The agent constructs a system prompt with the user’s input and interacts with the language model in a continuous loop, checking for actions or final answers.\n",
    "   - If a tool is needed (e.g., a calculator), the agent will invoke the appropriate tool, observe the result, and feed the output back into its reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Final Output**:\n",
    "   - The agent continues looping through the **Thought → Action → Observation** cycle until a final answer is generated or the task cannot be completed. Once complete, the result is stored in the agent’s state, and the final answer is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this process, the agent will have used reasoning and external tools to autonomously solve the problem presented by the user.\n",
    "\n",
