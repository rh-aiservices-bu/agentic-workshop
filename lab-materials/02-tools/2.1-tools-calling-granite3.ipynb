    "2. **Executor Forwards Prompt to LLM**: The **Executor** forwards the userâ€™s prompt to the **LLM** (LLM) for initial processing.\n",
    "3. **LLM Processes the Prompt**: The **LLM** analyzes the prompt and determines whether it can generate a response directly or if external tools are needed to complete the request.\n",
    "4. **LLM Requests External Tool Invocation**: If external data or additional resources are required (e.g., real-time data from a search engine or a code interpreter), the **Model** signals the **Executor** to call the relevant tool.\n",
    "5. **Executor Calls the Tools**: The **Executor** initiates the tool request, calling external tools (such as Brave Search, Wolfram Alpha, Code Interpreter, or other custom tools) to fetch necessary information.\n",
    "6. **Tools Retrieve Data**: The external tools access the required information from outside environments (e.g., fetching real-time search results or performing complex calculations) and return the data to the **Executor**.\n",
    "7. **Executor Synthesizes Final Response**: The **Executor** combines the original prompt, the **LLM**'s processing, and any external tool responses. The final response is then sent back to the **LLM**.\n",
    "8. **LLM Generates Final Response**: The **LLM** synthesizes all the gathered data and generates a final response.\n",
    "9. **Executor Sends Response to User**: The **Executor** delivers the final response back to the user, completing the interaction."
