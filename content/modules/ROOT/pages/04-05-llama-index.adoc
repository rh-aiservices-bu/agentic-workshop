**Llama Index AI Framework** by Llama Index Inc. is an open-source solution for developing production-grade, multi-agent AI systems. This framework supports agents functioning autonomously within a scalable, orchestrated environment suited for real-world applications.

== Key Features and Capabilities

- **Agent-as-a-Service**: Each agent operates as a distinct service within the system, providing modularity and scalability. Agents can be easily added or adjusted based on the system's evolving needs.

- **Centralized Message Queue**: Agents communicate via a centralized message queue, publishing and pulling messages to coordinate tasks effectively and maintain smooth inter-agent communication.

- **Control Plane with Orchestration**: The framework includes a control plane that tracks tasks and services, dynamically assigning next steps through an orchestrator. This orchestrated control ensures efficient task handling and system stability.

- **Built-In CLI Tool**: Llama Index offers a command-line interface to monitor and manage agent services. This CLI enables real-time tracking, direct interaction, and troubleshooting of agent activities.
