SQL Retriever Agents leverage the power of LLMs to interact with SQL databases, enabling dynamic and 
intelligent query generation. 
These agents can answer complex questions by accessing structured data and 
executing multi-step processes to retrieve and analyze information.

== **How SQL Retriever Agents Work**

SQL Retriever Agents operate by combining LLM capabilities with structured database interactions. 

The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Retrieve Tables**: The agent queries the database to get a list of tables and their metadata.  
2. **Identify Relevant Tables**: The agent determines which tables are most relevant to the user’s query.  
3. **Understand Table Structure**: The agent fetches the schema or structure of the relevant tables.  
4. **Generate Query**: The agent creates an SQL query based on the user’s input and the table structure.  
5. **Validate Query**: The agent checks the query for errors or inconsistencies.  
6. **Execute Query**: The agent runs the query and retrieves the data.  
7. **Handle Errors**: The agent refines the query if needed to resolve any issues.  
8. **Provide Results**: The agent formats the retrieved data into a clear and concise response.

== Exercise: SQL Retriever Agents - Practical Example

Let's see the SQL Retriever Agents in Action!

From the `agentic-workshop/lab-materials/05` folder, please open the notebook called `4.5-sql-agents.ipynb` and follow the instructions.

== **Example Use Cases**

- **Data Analytics**: Generating reports or extracting key insights from large datasets in SQL databases.  
- **Customer Queries**: Answering natural language questions about a database, such as “What were the top sales last quarter?”  
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automating routine SQL tasks, such as generating performance metrics or updating data.  

== **Benefits of SQL Retriever Agents**

- **Dynamic Querying**: Allows agents to adapt queries to user input and database schema dynamically.  
- **Error Mitigation**: By iteratively refining queries, agents ensure accurate results even when errors occur.  
- **Ease of Use**: Enables users to query complex databases using natural language, removing the need for SQL expertise.  
- **Scalability**: SQL Retriever Agents can operate across multiple databases and integrate with broader workflows seamlessly.
